Input Instructions:

for each operand, we split the attribute by ", ", so if there is any error character, the whole program will crash. 
The dependency starts from line 14(if the first line is number 1). each line in the dependency area will contains two string: 
the second one will depend on the first one. Note that there is only one space between the two string, any other thing put in the line will lead a crash. (even a space, it's hard for detection.)

some example for translate the attribute into our input format:
if there are n (n>=2) grouping variables in the query. we need to set them from 1 to n
 x.state -> state_1
 sum(x.quant) -> sum_quant_1
 x.month = month -> rs.getInt("month") == fs.month
